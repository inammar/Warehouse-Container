# Warehouse-Container

Project goal - to analyze boxes in the warehouse. 

All data about boxes are stored in txt file (I used Notepad): material type, length, width, height, max weight the box can contain and the number of boxes allowed to place on each other. 

The program writes data of boxes into the table.

The program finds the box with max weight, calculates the shelves height.

The program filters boxes with particular material type to the separate list and sorts this list according to the max weight of the box.

Data output is done to the Console.
